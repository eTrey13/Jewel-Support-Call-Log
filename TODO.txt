Notes in support history cutting out ------------
Hide start/end time -----------
-When only showing one church, only show church/conference on top
-Church clickable link to church page

-Church page - full treasurer info, notes, link to church call history tickets and time

-Change default entries shown in table

-Have church/conference selector at top of call log pages

-Dashboard for agents showing their tickets and total time, restrictable by month
Admin can see each agents Dashboard
-Page for each conference showing their tickets and total time, who to contact for support

Agents can edit their own tickets the same delay

Add new churches

Standardize terminology: what?

admins dashboards - manage users/passwords, add churches/conferemces, view call minutes, edit tickets

database field, notes on treasurer

-Ask grandpa what to do for yellow conference - confirm instead of alert

Add agent names

Page with all agents and contact info

Indicate spanish is needed when selecting treasurer

checkboxes bigger/not blue?

edit (add? remove?) treasurers in church page

figure out the table width stuff...

-create a new helper file with functions to call to get certain DB stuff, figure out how to do sql the same there

users that aren't agents?

add contact info to conferences Table, show in conference page

remove start/end time from add call data
-load with current time in start time, add button to set end time to current time



-show multiple months - see image (this month, last month, previous three months, last year, all)

-custom sort for date column in calls-table

-conference office needs to be church, link to it in conference page

show in conference page if supported

-look into pressing enter searches by church, not conference

-alphabetize churches in conference/church selector

-churches page can get filtered by conference

organize templates in folders

is custom sort the right way? ask mom
view all link in church/conference page needed? ask mom - removed for now - <a href="/view-calls?conferenceID={{ conference.conferenceID }}">View all</a>
should pressing enter search by church/conference instead of being disabled? ask mom
remove "support calls" text in conference page? (And church?) ask mom
